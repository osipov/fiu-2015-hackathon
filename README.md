#On this page you will find the getting started instructions and sample code for the FIU Cloud Hackathon at the [CEN4083 Introduction to Cloud Computing](http://visa.cis.fiu.edu/tiki/cen4083) course.

Before starting with any of the following instructions, ensure that you have IBM Bluemix account. You can register for one here: https://apps.admin.ibmcloud.com/manage/trial/bluemix.html

0. **What is IBM Bluemix?** IBM Bluemix is a open source based cloud computing platform for building, running, and managing applications. Bluemix is built on  [Cloud Foundry](http://cloudfoundry.org/about/index.html), a [Platform as a Service]() technology with a broad community both contributing and supporting the project. With IBM Bluemix, developers can focus on writing code instead of worrying about how to setup hardware, install and upgrade operating systems, deploy Cloud Foundry, or maintain a high level of availability for cloud infrastructure and applications.
